h1 DESIGN

I created the acceptance tests based on the specified requirements and then I tried to implement the behaviour as simple as possible. I chose not to create low level tests because I knew the code would change over the commits and low level tests would give me false alarms. As it looked that the focus of the challenge was on the back end, I didn't focus on the presentation.
